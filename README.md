# RoadRunner
Where dreams meet miles.
Join the movement today

The project that we will be creating in MSCI 342 is called Road Runner. This project addresses a large problem that we as group members have seen in our life. There is currently no way to have a centralized running tracking leaderboard amongst only your friends. Our project will provide a unique platform that allows users to input workouts and statistics regarding their marathon training, and show it off to their friends who are also competing. Although existing systems such as Strava have the ability to track workouts and statistics, there is no way to train for a singular race together as a friend group. Our product also allows friend groups to assign points to different workouts and statistics, which allows for a leaderboard amongst friends to show who is leading for certain periods of training. These features are not offered in Strava or other competing applications, and this shows how our product highlights the importance of motivation through friendly competition.
